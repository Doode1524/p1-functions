# Getting Started

- Run `npm install` in the terminal to install the dependencies.
- To run the tests in watch mode: `jest --watch index.test`
- Type `a` to run the tests, or follow the prompts for other options.

# Function Basics

- Any parameters (arguments) that we pass to a function go into the parentheses.
- All logic goes inside the curly braces.
- All functions must return something, somehow.
- Note: if our return value can fit on one line, we can omit the curly braces.


# greet()
- Takes in a `name` as a parameter.
- Should return a string with the following greeting:
    - Hello, [name]! Welcome to JavaScript!
- The solution may include `string interpolation` or `concatenation`.
    - String interpolation is preferred over concatenation.
    - String interpolation is more readable.

# sayGoodbye()
- Takes in a `name` as a parameter.
- Should return a string with the following message:
    - Goodbye, [name]!
- The solution may include `string interpolation` or `concatenation`.
